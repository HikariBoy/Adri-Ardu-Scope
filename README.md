# Adri-Ardu-Scope
 Creates the basic functionality of an Oscilloscope (plus Spectrum Annalyser and cross-correlation scope) from a very low cost Arduino to allow the ability to explore signals, collect data and complete high-school/University laboratories even when students are completing portions of their studies remotely.
